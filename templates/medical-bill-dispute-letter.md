Dear Billing Department,

   - Charged: $[金额]
   - Issue: [说明问题]
   - Evidence: [证据]

2. [具体错误2]:
   - Charged: $[金额]
   - Issue: [说明问题]
   - Evidence: [证据]

[或者使用下面的具体例子]

## 具体错误模板

### 重复收费
```
I was charged twice for [服务名称]:
- Charge 1: $[金额] on [日期]
- Charge 2: $[金额] on [日期]
This appears to be a duplicate charge for the same service.
```

### 未接受的服务
```
I was charged for [服务名称] which I did not receive.
According to my records, this service was not provided during
my visit. Please review and remove this charge.
```

### 编码错误
```
The CPT code [代码] appears incorrect for the service I received.
The correct code should be [正确代码], which has a different fee.
```

### 价格不合理
```
The charge of $[金额] for [服务] is significantly higher than
the fair market value. According to Healthcare Bluebook, the
fair price range is $[金额]. I request adjustment to a
reasonable amount.
```

## 结尾段落

```
I request that you:
1. Review and correct these errors
2. Provide an updated itemized bill
3. Adjust the total amount owed
4. Respond within 30 days

I am willing to pay the correct amount once the bill has been
corrected. However, I will not pay the disputed charges until
this matter is resolved.

Please contact me at [电话] or [email] to discuss this matter.

I have enclosed copies of [支持文件].

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
